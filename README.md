## Pirate Booty  
This is a coin flip and dice game that me and a classmate created as the final project for our Software Engineering class.  
It features a login and create account menu that connects to a server and database.  
This is a pirate-themed gambling game.

**NOTE:**  
We used SQLite to run the database associated with tracking users.

## HOW TO PLAY
- Run the server first, then run main  
- Login or create a new account  
- Place a desired amount to bet  
- Choose either heads or tails if in the coin game  
- Choose between 1-6 if in the dice game  
- Press bet  
- You can also click on the leaderboard to view the top players on your local machine
